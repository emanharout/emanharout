            <p>I'm a programmer dedicated to crafting clean, robust code. My love for learning led me to this path.</p>
            <p>But my love for learning goes far beyond programming. This site is my platform for sharing insights gained by my curiosityâ€”of both the Arts and Sciences. I embrace my generalist tendencies, contrary to prevailing wisdom that pushes specialization. I'm excited to live in a time where the whole of human knowledge is unleashed by the internet. I intend to enjoy it and trust it will yield positive real-world impact.</p>
